2) Scanning
3) Exploit
4) Gain foothold (back to step 1)
5) Cover tracks


- Black stage: no info is given (similar to an external attacker)
- Gray stage: partial info is given (similar to an inside job simulation)
- White stage: full network asset is given (thorough evaluation, similar to persistent access and recon)

## Reconnaissance

OSSINT Methods

OSSINT is perfectly legal and not intrusive (inconspiuous) since it consists of scanning publically available information
- DNS records
- Google search
- Shodan
- crt.sh
- recon-ng

OSSINT Reconnaissance grants a "free" view of information about the target that doesn't trigger suspicion 

## Scanning

Scanning will often show up in logs and trigger IDS rules

Scanning will show possible vectors for attack. 
- network topography (systems, services)
- unpatched services
- insecured configurations


Tools
- nmap
- nse (nmap scripting engine)
- zenmap (graphical version of nmap, easier for nse)
- nessus
- OpenVAS

Scannning grants intimate details about the network (depending on vantage point). However these scans will often trigger alerts and logs, so care must be taken to balance agression, inconspicuousness, and urgency.


## Exploit
